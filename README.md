### "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself."

### Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. 
### It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. 
### It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

### These instructions illustrate all major features of Beautiful Soup 4, with examples. 
### I show you what the library is good for, how it works, how to use it, how to make it do what you want, and what to do when it violates your expectations.

### This document covers Beautiful Soup version 4.9.2. 
### The examples in this documentation should work the same way in Python 2.7 and Python 3.8.

### You might be looking for the documentation for Beautiful Soup 3. 
### If so, you should know that Beautiful Soup 3 is no longer being developed and that support for it will be dropped on or after December 31, 2020. 
### If you want to learn about the differences between Beautiful Soup 3 and Beautiful Soup 4, see Porting code to BS4.
